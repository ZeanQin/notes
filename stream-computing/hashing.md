# What is hashing
A hash is like a fingerprint for data. A hash function takes your data — which can be any length — as an input, and gives you back an identifier of a smaller (usually), fixed (usually) length, which you can use to index or compare or identify the data.

> **Intuition**: a hash function builds a (sometimes not strict, i.e. collision) one-to-one relationship between a piece of data and a number
