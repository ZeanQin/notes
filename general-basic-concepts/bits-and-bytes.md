# Bits and Bytes

At the smallest scale in the computer, information is stored as bits and bytes. In this section, we'll look at how that works.

## Bit
* a "bit", like an atom, the smallest unit of storage
* A bit stores just a 0 or 1
* "In the computer it's all 0's and 1's" ... bits
* Anything with two separate states can store 1 bit 
*  -Nick's tennis racket example
* In a chip: electric charge = 0/1
* In a hard drive: spots of North/South magnetism = 0/1
* A bit is too small to be much use
* Group 8 bits together to make 1 byte


> Everything in a computer is 0's and 1's ... what does that mean? The bit stores just a 0 or 1 .. it's the smallest building block of storage.

## Byte
* One byte = grouping of 8 bits
* e.g. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
* One byte can store one character, e.g. 'A' or 'x' or '$'

## How Many Patterns With N Bits? (demo)
How many different patterns can be made with 1, 2, or 3 bits?
