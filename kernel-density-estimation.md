# What is Kernel
The Probability Density Function is a function that used to specify the possibility of a continous random variable falling within a particular range of values (as apposed to taking on any value). This probability is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. An example probability density function is as below:
